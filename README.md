# game-farmer-cs
Farmer game is another iteration of my course project, but this one was written using C#

--Foreword

This game demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming. To do my best I used polymorhism, inheritance and agregation.

--Rules

Game end when player gets 200 points. Player should seed and harvest plants to get points. After harvesting player sells goods in HarvestBarn (right one). 
To get seeds player interacts with SeedBarn (left one).
